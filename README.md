We talk a lot about Gender Inequality, but not a lot about actively trying to overcome it. Here we have a set of 17 scenarios we came up with based mostly off personal experience. We then posed to them two questions:
+ What can they do, as a member of society, to help the woman feel more comfortable?
+ What can be done, by society as a whole, to achieve the same?
    + How can society get to such a stage?

Recommendations:
+ Groups should be made of not more than four people, so as to facilitate involvement of everyone.
+ A single group should get a single scenario, so that their focus remains on one subject.
+ Every scenario should be individually discussed with the group to prevent misunderstandings.    


Please note that in this document the term 'woman' can be loosely interpreted to mean 'any member of a minority'. The related document details scenarios faced predominently by cis-gendered women mainly because:
+ all of us who worked on this were cis-gendered women
+ the primary audience were people who discriminate cis-gendered women. These people would find the idea of a third (and multiple) gender abhorant, and then we would loose them before we even begun.
