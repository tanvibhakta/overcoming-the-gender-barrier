1. After a long day at work, your all-men team decide to get some dinner.

2. To combat fast-approaching deadlines, your very collaborative all-men team decides to pull an all-nighter at one of their houses.

3. Your colleagues decide to go out far away as a group excursion. They only have private vehicles as a means of transport.

4. Your male colleagues frequently misuse words like 'rape', 'molest', and 'bitch' in their personal but loud communication.

5. Your colleagues have all decided to attend a conference in a city requiring overnight travel from yours and you're the only woman on the team.

6. You can attend a career-changing conference/event in another city but you feel like you shouldn't leave your husband and kids alone, even if it's just a couple of days.

7. You want to be more active in a technical group in your college/work-place but your management frowns heavily on inter-gender interaction.

8. You have exactly the same qualifications as a friend but were denied a leadership position.

9. Because you are good at what you do, you are expected to represent all women. You are frequently put on display and expected to be impeccable. When you do something less than perfect, you are perceived as a failure, someone who leads people on and further incapable. (The Madonna complex)

10. In a team expected to handle all parts of building a project, you get the less technical work such as minute-noting, secretarial, documentation-handling or marketing despite you being equally (or even better) versed with the technology you have to work on as your male counterparts.

11. When you reveal that you drink/crack a dirty joke/anything else informal you are told that you are 'not like the other girls'.

12. You attend a workshop that you want to continue working on but the organizing team is fully male.

13. You approached someone to talk about joining their organization but two men hit on you.

14. You were asked questions about your marital status, your desire to conceive or your better half's profession at your job interview.

15. You are expected to wear traditional women's clothing (Kurtis, saris) in a position where your clothing has absolutely no bearing on what you do.

16. You make sure to have gender-neutral handles/emails etc online because you are otherwise discriminated against / asked to prove that you are a girl, etc

17. You are perceived to have a greater professional advantage because of your small number and the large number of schemes and scholarships you have due to this minority status.

18. You are believed to be okay with the rampant sexism because 'you have had so long to get used to it'

19. You are not sure whether you are willing to compromise on certain decisions because you really want to or because you have internalized society's expectations of you.
